## Introduction

I beleive my technical skills and experience within the ecosystem would make me a great candidate for the council. I've been building on Algorand since 2021 with Algogator and since 2023 with CompX.

## Relevant Experience

Web3 Experience: Algogator, CompX, weDev, Citrus Swap
Web2 Experience: Building front end react/Remix applications and noce.js backend applications 

General Experience: I've been a developer for over 10 years, having started in the games industry, through consulting and then finally into blockchain and web3. During that time I've built and led mutliple enterprise grade applications for some of the worlds biggest companies - Amazon, Coca Cola, Canon etc. I've managed and led departments and smaller teams during my time and feel i have a good track record in terms of project completion and correctness.

In web3 I try to stand for transparency, openness and a willingness to learn.
