## Introduction

I've been involved in the Algorand ecosystem since late 2019 and actively building since 2020. I created the smart contracts for NFDs, the contracts and node daemon for Reti open-pooling, the Haydrops contracts, as well as all the backend services, public APIs and infrastructure for TxnLab projects.

With extensive knowledge of the chain, I aim to ensure that any proposals meet the appropriate criteria for the betterment of the network and its ecosystem.

## Relevant Experience

I’ve been a programmer for over four decades, with deep experience in databases, systems programming, networking, cloud infrastructure, email systems, build pipelines, CI/CD, and since 2020, blockchain dApps (including smart contracts and backend-to-frontend integrations).  

I’ve been an active member of the Algorand Discord since 2019, helping users and builders. I also created and manage a long-standing Algorand 'unofficial' Telegram channel.
