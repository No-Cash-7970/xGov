## Introduction

I'm applying to become an xGov council member to represent the Russian-speaking crypto community and contribute real-world insights. I believe Algorand must be built on principles of decentralization, law-compliance, and technical excellence. I want to strengthen regional participation in the ecosystem and ensure that governance remains fair and community-led.
