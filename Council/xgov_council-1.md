## Introduction

I am an entrepreneur and full-stack developer with five years of experience building on Algorand. My focus has been on developing innovative blockchain solutions, fostering community engagement, and enhancing decentralized governance.

By joining the xGov council, I aim to further strengthen the decentralization aspect of the AF governance model, bring new ideas for improvements, advocate for open-source development, and ensure meaningful contributions that benefit the entire community.

## Additional Information

### My Vision for the Future of Algorand

In my view, Algorand should evolve into a truly public entity with a highly decentralized governance structure. All decisions should be made transparently and be subject to public voting. Financial accounting, along with all agreements, should be fully open and accessible. Likewise, the management of the Algorand source code and even elections of C-level representatives should follow a decentralized model.

Startup funding could follow a structured approach:
The first stage would consist of local or global ideathon events. The next phase would be hackathons, where the best-performing projects are rewarded and offered entry into an accelerator program. The outcomes of these hackathons should be transparent, and constructive feedback must be provided to all participating teams. Continued engagement with funded projects should be prioritized to help them reach a critical mass of users and long-term sustainability.

As a matter of principle, I am not in favor of retroactive grants. Funding should prioritize future potential rather than compensating for work already completed. Projects that aim to achieve mass adoption should enter through the accelerator program. The selection process for this program should be entirely transparent, and applicants should receive clear feedback on how to improve their chances of selection. However, if the Algorand Foundation decides to allocate funding solely through retroactive grants, I will submit proposals for several projects that have not yet received support. In such cases, I will abstain from voting on my own proposals to avoid any conflict of interest.

All projects should be treated equally. There should be no direct funding from Algorand to individual projects. Any project seeking financial support should go through a public funding process—namely, the accelerator phase.
