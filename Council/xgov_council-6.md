## Introduction

Hi AlgoFam! My name is Joseph Wu, Stanford University B.S. and M.S. with 8 years of experience working in Tech industry. I have been a part of the Algorand ecosystem for 6 years now. My focus in blockchain has been dApp development, specifically infrastructure and consumer use cases.

I love the Algorand ecosystem (from developers to users, the Foundation, and more). I believe with my expertise and experience, I will be an effective advocate for Algorand stakeholders and also a fair council member to guide the governance process. 

I humbly ask the Algorand community to support my candidacy, and let's make Algorand better together!

## Relevant Experience

I have been a part of the Algorand ecosystem for 6 years, from governance, to accelerator, to hackathons, and beyond. Here is a summary

Algorand Governance - I've participated in most of the Algorand governance periods and I have the OG Governor and Whale Governor NFTs to prove it. 

Algorand x Draper accelerator - I was a part of the Algorand x Draper accelerator in 2021, which incubated various startups building on the Algorand blockchain. My project, Gift Ledger, was ultimately declined for funding by the Algorand Foundation.

Algorand General - I was the global and blockchain category winner of the Algorand sponsored Duke-Harvard hackathon by Live AI. I've had experience interacting with major DeFi systems in Algorand such as Folks Finance, Messina, and Tinyman. I have submitted and reviewed ARC proposals on Algorand forum, engaged on Algorand Discord server and Reddit forum. 

Blockchain General - I was a category winner in ETHDenver 2023. I was invited as a builder to the Solana IslandDAO hacker house in 2024. I was a category winner in the Permissionless III hackathon, where I worked with various techonologies from Bitcoin L2 and L1 chains like Supra. Experience and exposure to various technologies in the blockchain space will help me bring valuable insight and perspective to the role of a council member. 

I'm a coordinator and active member of blockchain organizations around Washington DC, including DC DAO, Virginia Blockchain Council, Blockchain Policy Institute. I've been a part of various blockchain policy discussions/forums at the Capitol as well as workshops at the Federal Reserve. I have contacts with lobbyists and staffers who work in the blockchain space. I believe my proximity and network in the DC scene will be an additional value add as Algorand continues to make inroads with enterprise and government use cases (e.g. Silvio's Fiat Chain announcement).

General Experience - Most of my formal work experience (8 years post Education) has been in Product Development/Management. I'm a decent programmer and have done extensive programming in prototyping and validation in blockchain, esp in Algorand. Combination of Product/Business and Technical skills will serve my candidacy well.
