## Introduction

I have been a long term builder in Algorand. I have been involved in many projects, leading Pact & Humble, as well as running one of the largest and most active discord groups for Algorand - Algonauts (who has hosted multiple community led AlgoFest and other events). Algorand has been my home and I am very passionate about the ecosystem, and will do all I can to see it grow and find the success it deserves.
