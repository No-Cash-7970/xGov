## Introduction

Hello all. I'm applying to serve as an xGov Councilor to do my part in shaping a fairer and more efficient public goods funding process on Algorand. I’ve long advocated for improving both governance and public goods funding, as I believe these are critical components of Algorand’s economic flywheel. Many of my suggestions have been implemented, such as only funding retroactive proposals, or setting up this council.

As an xGov Council member, I will bring a thoughtful, principled approach to decision-making and uphold a commitment to holding both myself and the community to the highest standards. My goal is to help build trust in the xGov process by promoting transparency and long-term thinking. I will continue to be critical of the process until we see results tangibly improving.

## Relevant Experience

My background is in finance and accounting. I’ve been in crypto since 2017, and began actively building in 2021. While I’m not a trained developer, I have a solid understanding of Algorand through hands-on involvement in building multiple protocols. I view blockchains not only as technical marvels, but as economic ones and that perspective shapes how I think about governance and incentives.

Since joining the Algorand ecosystem, I’ve been a part of many communities, but my proudest contribution is co-founding TxnLab. We’ve built several core products including nf.domains, use-wallet, the Reti Pooling Protocol, and most recently, Haydrops.

I’ve also written extensively about governance, public goods, and economic design in crypto. Find links below.
