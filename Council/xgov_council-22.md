## Introduction

I am applying to become an xGov Council member to help advance efficient and equitable governance of Algorand. I believe governance is a fundamental pillar of blockchain decentralization, which I view as one of the core benefits of blockchain technology. Decentralization creates trust among people by reducing the risks of censorship, manipulation, and downtime of systems. To support this vision, I have been actively contributing to Algorand's decentralization by running multiple nodes and participating in its governance programs since their beginnings - from the initial referendum to general governance and xGov programs.

As an xGov Council member, I would contribute even more effectively to Algorand’s decentralization. If elected, I will focus on:
1. Establishing clear rules for a transparent and efficient xGov Council, as well as the broader xGov program.
2. Prioritizing innovative, sustainable solutions that address the needs of non-crypto natives and use cases beyond finance.
3. Further increasing the decentralization of the Algorand network.

## Relevant Experience

I am a versatile engineer and founder with a strong academic background. I studied electrical engineering at University of Ljubljana and TU Munich, and made my PhD at ETH Zurich in the field of mechatronics. I have been building blockchain solutions on Algorand for the past five years, winning multiple competitions that resulted in co-funding Valar Solutions GmbH, the company developing the [Valar](https://www.stake.valar.solutions/) peer-to-peer staking platform. My primary development focus is on smart contracts. As a co-founder of a young startup, I am closely involved in the startup space and am familiar with challenges faced by founders. I have experience with grant application processes with many blockchain ecosystems as well as scientific research projects.
