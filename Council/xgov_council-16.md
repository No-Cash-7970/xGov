## Introduction

I'm Scott Bolasevich, known to some as Flipping, and I've been active in the Algorand ecosystem since 2019. As a full-stack developer on Algorand, I've consistently tried to contribute and collaborate with others since I arrived. I'm a fan of open source and enjoy sharing code with the community. You can see below that I've documented much of that work. However, despite my repeated offers to help, the level of gatekeeping and cronyism displayed—both publicly and privately—at the highest levels of the Algorand ecosystem has made it incredibly difficult for me to take this application, or anything related to Algorand leadership, seriously. I'm still ready to contribute to the Algorand Governance Council, just as I was the last time I offered my time and was disingenuously "invited" to contribute to the ATAC council. Some of the same individuals who intentionally ignored me are still in roles at the Foundation today. If elected—by some miracle—I will work hard to push the ecosystem forward. I have many original ideas and suggestions, all of which have previously been blatantly and, in my view, intentionally ignored. I am not a fan of the status quo or most of the Foundation's current initiatives, which I view as largely ineffective, if not outright failures. My perspective comes primarily from a developer and user/community engagement standpoint. Thank you for considering my candidacy.
