## Introduction

Hi everyone, I'm Michael T Chuang (michaeltchuang.algo).  I've been involved in the Algorand ecosystem since 2022 mainly as an Algorand node runner (~3000+ blocks proposed so far) and recently as an Android dev working on Pera Wallet.  I also attend/participate in the Algorand Dev Council meetings and hop on algofam twitter spaces whenever I can.

As an xGov Council member, I'll champion sustainable long-term practices and also aim to ensure that any proposals meet the appropriate criteria for improving the ecosystem.

## Relevant Experience

I have over a decade of mobile development experience serving as a tech lead at Marvel/Disney/ESPN on numerous Android and analytics projects, followed by several years as a paid open-source contributor at various startups.

After submitting several open-source PRs to enhance Pera Wallet as an Android user, I was invited to join the Algorand Foundation for the past six months (October 2024 - May 2025) as Android Tech Lead for Pera Wallet. In this role, I helped bring initiatives like ARC-59/Asset Inbox, ARC-78/Staking Portal, Immersve Card, and Universal HD Wallets to the finish line. I've now returned to being an open source contributor again, dedicating my free time to the new AlgoKit-Core project, specifically assisting with their mobile SDK build-out in 2025 Q3/Q4.
