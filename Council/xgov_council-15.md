## Introduction

Algorand related activities constitute my full time job. That includes running Nodely, participating in ATC & Dev councils, interacting both with AF and AT on a daily basis. 

Not relaying on grants gives me space for long-term planning. I am prioritizing diversified ecosystem growth by helping new projects and fully expect profitable teams to contribute back - like Nodely is striving to do.
